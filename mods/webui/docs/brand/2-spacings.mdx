# Spacings

We use the Material-UI (MUI) spacing scale, which is based on increments of 4, 8, and 16, etc. to define the spacings in our design system.

<br />
These increments ensure consistency and scalability across components and
layouts. For more details, refer to the [MUI Spacing
documentation.](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/spacing/)
